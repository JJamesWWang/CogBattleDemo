# Cog Battle Demo

This is a combination of a CLI and Panda3D to demonstrate a simplified version
of a cog battle in Toontown: Corporate Clash. It was made specifically for my
application at Corporate Clash.

## Setup

Assuming you have Panda3D installed (v1.10.9)
```bash
ppython -m pip install -r requirements.txt
ppython main.py
```

Once the program is launched, there should be instructions at the top left of
the window. You want to make sure that the command line is visible while you 
are in the demo because it will print out the status of the cog battle.

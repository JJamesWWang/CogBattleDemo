# Cog Battle Demo

This is a combination of a CLI and Panda3D to demonstrate a simplified version
of a cog battle in Toontown: Corporate Clash. It was made specifically for my
application at Corporate Clash.

## Setup

Assuming you have Panda3D installed (v1.10.9)
```bash
ppython -m pip install -r requirements.txt
ppython main.py
```
